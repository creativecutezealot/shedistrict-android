         * app_update :
         * ceo_msg : Hey, girl! Thank you for joining us.
         Nothing inspired the vision and development of SheDistrict more than the fact that I faced a huge problem that I know other women are also facing - the lack of friendships and connections being made with each other. It was February 2019 when I realized that I wanted to stop complaning about not being able to make friends in a big city and actualy solve the problem by creating something that would evetually turn out to be bigger than myself.
         Iâ€™m so excited to be in this joureny to creating long lasting friendships with all of you.
